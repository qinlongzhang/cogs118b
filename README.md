# cogs118b
For cogs118b project Unet
In this project, my group will attempt to do image segmentation using Unet and test on the automatic driving dataset. If we have extra time, hopefully, we can make it a bit practical, like accepting the video, and do the image segmentation of this video.  We will be building our network using keras's library and use tensorflow as backend. We will split the task to each memeber of the group to ensure each person can do his own part.

Hello
